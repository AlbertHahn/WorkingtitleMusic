# WorkingtitleMusic
 
It's the hottest day of the year and the equally hottest band is about to perform. You step into the role of not just any viewer but of the band's manager. Players are about to pass out due to these temperatures! Luckily there are lots of rhythmic volunteers to pick from TO KEEP THE SHOW GOING
-------------------------------------
A group of musicians, they want to get fame.
But there is no instructor, so they go insane.
All musicians want to gain fame. 
But this heat drives them insane​.
Can YOU help them, so they grow big?
Or will they end up als little pig?
Can you help them keep their tune?
Before the heat makes the musicians swoon.
Lead them to music, the will study.
They even sacrifice somthing bloody.
Probably not, the´re the good guys,
Help them or not and mach krassen sche!ss.
Take charge and keep the music playing.
Keep the rock on and keep on slaying .
